<h2>â€¢ Short Description of my project</h2>
<p>The Referred Project is a Car Rental System. The Business Application is GUI based and it solves many Purposes that a Car Rental System usually does. 
The Transition from Console base to GUI based has been an intuitive and user-friendly experience. 
The best thing about this System is that it provide User Control over the system which was lacking in Console based System.
This application is very user-friendly as it provides a separate menu for Admin as well as Customers. </p>
